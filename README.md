**Title** : Implement authentication and authorization flows in your iOS apps

**Abstract** : Learn how to leverage custom authentication flows and social-provider identity federation (log in with Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) in your iOS application. You do this hands-on by building and deploying a modern iOS app using AWS Amplify and serverless services such as AWS AppSync (GraphQL API), Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon S3. This workshop is suitable for all, even if you're not a cloud expert. This is an iOS/SwiftUI hands-on development workshop; please bring your own Mac with Xcode 11 already installed (it's too large to be downloaded or installed during the workshop). Having Python 3 and Node.js installed will speed things up.
