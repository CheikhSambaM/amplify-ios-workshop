## BOA302

**Build an iOS Native App with a Cloud-Based Backend**

Take the workshop !  Visit [https://amplify-ios-workshop.go-aws.com](https://amplify-ios-workshop.go-aws.com)

In this workshop, you will create a data-driven native iOS app, integrated with a cloud-based backend. You will use Amazon Cognito (http://aws.amazon.com/cognito) to manage user authentication. We will adopt an offline-first data strategy with a local database and automatic data synchronization through GraphQL API (https://graphql.org/learn/) to back our data in Amazon DynamoDB (https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). Weâ€™ll demonstrate how to use the AWS Amplify (https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) library to authenticate users, to communicate with our API, and to download images from Amazon S3 (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
