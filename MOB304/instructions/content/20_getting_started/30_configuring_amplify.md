This workshop proposes to use [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) to create and integrate with a cloud-based backend.  AWS Amplify comprises two components: a [command line tool](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli-toolchain/quickstart) to easily provision cloud-based services from your laptop and a [library](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/ios/start) to access these services from your application code. You installed the CLI as part of the [prerequisites instructions](/10_prerequisites/20_installs.html#installing-or-updating).  Now we integrate Amplify tools with your Xcode project.

## Add Amplify to your application

Amplify for iOS is distribued through Cocoapods as a Pod. In this section, youâ€™ll setup cocoa pods and add the required Amplify packages.

Amplify will create a local directory structure to host your project's meta-data.  In addition, it will create the backend resources to host your project : two IAM roles, an S3 bucket and a AWS Cloudformation template.  After 1 or 2 minutes, you should see the below messages:
