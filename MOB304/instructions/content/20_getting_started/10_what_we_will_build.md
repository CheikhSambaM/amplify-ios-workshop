During this workshop, we are going to add a cloud-based authentication and API backend to an existing iOS application.  We will start with Apple's SwiftUI Example App, starting at the phase "[Handling User Input](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/tutorials").  The workshop provides steps-by-steps instruction to create and configure the backend and to modify the client code.

The application will use :

- [Amazon Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html) to authenticate users
- [AWS AppSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/appsync/latest/devguide/welcome.html) to call a GraphQL API to access its data set
- [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html) to access images
