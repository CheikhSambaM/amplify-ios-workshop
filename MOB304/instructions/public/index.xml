If you already have an AWS account, have IAM Administrator access and have access key and secret key, you can skip this page.

      <description>Before we begin coding, there are a few things we need to install, update, and configure on your laptop.
Apple Software In order to develop native applications for iOS, you need to have XCode installed on your laptop. You can download and install XCode from Apple&amp;rsquo;s App Store. The download is ~2Gb, so it might take up to one hour depending on your network connection.
Installing and updating You need different command line tools to be installed : aws, amplify and jq.</description>
