<p style='text-align: left;'>
In this workshop, we will create a data-driven native iOS app, integrated with a cloud-based backend.  We will use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cognito" target="_blank">AWS Cognito</a> to manage user authentication and we'll use AWS AppSync to get up and running quickly with a GraphQL API that backs our data in Amazon DynamoDB. We'll demonstrate how to use the AWS Amplify library to authenticate users, to communicate with our API, and to download images from Amazon S3.
