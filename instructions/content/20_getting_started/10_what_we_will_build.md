During this workshop, we are going to add a cloud-based authentication and API backend to an existing iOS application.  We will start with Apple's SwiftUI Example App, starting at the phase "[Handling User Input](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/tutorials").  The workshop provides steps-by-steps instruction to create and configure the backend and to modify the client code.

The application will use :

- AWS Cognito to authenticate users
- AWS AppSync to call a GraphQL API to access its data set
- Amazon S3 to access images
